>**_My very first own library!_**<br>_This project is about coding a C library_</br>

<p align="justified">
  C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
  standard functions.<br>This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
  implementing and learning to use them.</br>It's about creating your own library that will
  be helpful in the future projects.
